*** seven phases of reconstruction
 1. Confederate states in the Union; run by "white power"
 2. Secession: states in Confederacy; again "white power" structure
 3. Martial law; occupied by Union
 4. "Reconstructed" und Johnson; white power stucture put back summer 1865, lasts till spring 1867
 5. Again, military rule; Johnson's regimes (except in TN) dibanded <- Reconstruction Act 1867
 6. Rebublican civilians in charge; not white power structure
    1. States back in Union
    2. "Bayonet Rule": Republican northerners running things, but military always there
    3. gov mostly voted on by freed blacks
 7. Redemption: structure reverted essentially to step 1

*** goals for reconstruction
 - Republicans ->
   - land ownership, education, suffrage for blacks
   - goodbye Johnson
 - Union back together

*** land reform
 - discussion of land given to freedmen
   - 40 acres + 1 mule
 - slave-owning society essentially still controls freedmen
   - not easily able to own land
   - land = freedom, therefore true freedom not easily obtained
   - more white sharecroppers

**** why land reform didn't happen
 - Northern whites didn't care
 - Only cared to give them the right to vote, as it would increase republican power
 - private property valued immensly by Americans
 - don't want to set "communist-like" precedent

*** republican rule
 - Republicans controlled confederate states during reconstruction (in office)
