* memory
** anterograde amnesia
Following trauma to the brain (concussion, surgery, or drug induced neural damage) we find we cannot make new memories. New information is just not encoding. We call this anterograde amnesia.

>---memory intact---|trauma|---no new memories--->

** infantile amnesia
 - Most people cannot remember anything before the age of three.
 - This is because the areas of the brain responsible for making and storing memories have not fully formed. (hippocampus and association areas)

** memory effects
 - Next-in-line Effect :: When you are so anxious about being next that you cannot remember what the person just before you in line says, but you can recall what other people around you say.
 - Spacing Effect :: We retain information better when we rehearse over time.
 - Serial Position Effect :: When your recall is better for first and last items on a list, but poor for middle items.
   - Primacy Effect :: We are more likely to recall the first few items on a list.
   - Recency Effect :: We are more likely to recall the last few items on a list.

** state-dependent memories
 - State dependent memories are retrieved when we are in the same mental or physiological state to when the memory was originally encoded.
   - Ex: Feelings of happiness can trigger memories of other times when we were happy.
   - Drugs alter a person's state of consciousness and can thus result in state-dependent memories as well.

** context-dependent memories
 - Context dependent memories are retrieved when we return to a situation that is similar to the one in which we originally encoded and stored the memory.
   - Ex: you return to Hermitage 10 years from now for your reunion and begin to remember all of the experiences you had while going there.
** inteference: the before and after of forgetting
 - Proactive Interference :: When older memories interfere with the learning of new material.
   - Ex: I'm having a hard time learning my new phone number because I keep remembering my old number.
 - Retroactive Interference :: When new memories prohibit the recall of older material.
   - Ex: Having learned your new phone number, you can't recall your old number.

** motivated forgetting
 - Motivated Forgetting :: People unknowingly revise their memories.
 - Repression :: A defense mechanism that banishes anxiety-arousing thoughts, feelings, and...
   - Repressed thoughts go deep into your unconscious mind, where they may surface as a dream or the expression of a behavior you might not be able to explain, or maybe a "slip of the tongue."

** forgetting: why do we forget?
 - Encoding Failure :: stuff didn't quite stick, too little rehearsal
 - Decay :: time erodes memories, remember Ebbinghaus' curve
 - Retrieval Failure :: just can't seem to call it up, such as "tip-of-the-tongue" phenomenon
 - Interference :: other memories getting in the way - retroactive & proactive
 - Disease & Brain Trauma :: dementia - such as Alzheimer's, concussions
 - Chemical Effect :: drugs can interere...

** false memories
 - Repressed or Constructed?
   - Some adults actually do forget childhood episodes of abuse.
 - False Memory Syndrome :: a condition in which a person's identity and relationships center around a false but strongly believed memory of a traumatic experience, which is sometimes induced by well-meaning therapists.

*** constucted memories
Elizabeth Loftus' research shows that memory is reconstructive, and that false memories can be triggered by suggestion.

*** source amnesia
Atributing to the wrong source an even we have experienced, heard about, read about, or imagined. It is at the heart of many false memories.

 - Ex: President Ronald Reagan used to tell stories of what happened to him when he was in the Army during WWII, but when fact-checked by reporters, it was found that some of his stories were actually memories from scenes of WWII movies he acted in.

** improving memory
 1. Study repeatedly to boost long-term recall.
 2. Spend more time rehearsing or actively thinking about the material.
 3. Make material personally meaningful.
 4. Use mnemonic devices:
    - Associate with peg words - something already stored
    - Make up a story
    - Chunk - acronyms
 5. Activate retrieval cues - mentally recreate the situation and mood
 6. Recall events while they are fresh - before you encounter misinformation
 7. Minimize interference:
    - Test your own knowledge
    - Rehearse and then determine what you do not yet know

* thinking
** cognition
Another term for thinking, knowing, and remembering

 - Metacognition: Awareness and understanding one's thinking and cognitive processes

*** concepts
 - A mental grouping of similar objects, events, ideas, or people
 - Superordinate - Animals
 - Basic - Dogs
 - Subordinate - Foxhound

**** schema
A schema is a set of ideas about something. Our stereotypes come from our schemas.

**** prototypes
A mental image or best (typical) example of a category.

If a new object is similar to our prototype, we are better able to recognize it.

*** creativity
 - Almost impossible to define
 - Little correlation between creativity and intelligence
 - Convergent Thinking versus Divergent Thinking

 - Convergent Thinking :: Involves narrowing your thoughts to try and find one correct answer
 - Divergent Thinking :: Involves finding multiple answers to a problem.

 - Components: Expertise, imaginative thinking skills, venturesome personality, intrinsic motivation, creative environment

*** algorithms
 - A rule that guarantees the right solution to a problem
 - Usually by using a formula
 - They work but are sometimes impractical
* language
** speech and language
 - Psycholinguists
 - Speech - act of speaking, producing sounds which do not have to by meaningful
 - Language - system of words and the rules for combining those words which does need to be meaningful
 - 2 basic elements
   - Symbols - words
   - Set of rules - grammar

*** phonemes
 - The smallest units of sound in a language
 - The sounds the letters make
 - English has about 44 phonemes

*** morphemes
 - The smallest unit of language that has meaning
 - Can be words like *a* or *but*
 - Can also be parts of words like prefixes or suffixes; ex *-ed* at the end of a word means past tense

*** syntax
 - The rules for combining words into grammatically sensible sentences.
 - In English, adjectives come before nouns, but not in Spanish

** language acquisition
Stages that we learn language:

 1. Babbling Stage
 2. Holophrastic Stage (one word stage)
 3. Telegraphic Speech Stage

After the telegraphic stage we get *overgeneralization*

*** cryin, cooing, & babbling stage
 - During their 2nd month

*** the two word stage
 - Before the 2nd year, a child starts to speak in two-word sentences. This form of speech is called *telegraphic speech* because the child speaks like a telegram: "Go car," means I world like to go for a ride in the car
 - Towards the end of the two word stage, children begin to _overregulate_ their speech by applying normal rules of speech to all of their words
 - For example, they might say "I runned" instead of "I ran"
* psychological disorders
** dissociative disorders
 - Dissociative Amnesia :: sudden onset memory loss usually following a traumatic event.
   - Cannot recall autobiographical information: event or period of time, identity, life history.
 - Dissociative Fugue :: sudden onset memory loss accompanied by relocation and the taking on of a new identity.
 - Depersonalization Disorder :: feeling detached from yourself, your body, and your surroundings

** mood disorders
*** major depressive disorder
Occurs when signs of depression last two weeks or more and are not caused by drugs or medical conditions

**** Signs
 1. Lethargy and fatigue
 2. Feelings of worthlessness
 3. Loss of interest in family & friends
 4. Loss of interest in activities

*** dysthymic disorder
Lies between a blue mood and major depressive disorder. It is a disorder characterized by daily depression lasting two years or more
